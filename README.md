## MatrixComputations

Simple repository containing C++ implementations of common matrix operations. While there are many C++ libraries with extensive linear algebra functionality, the primary purpose of this project is practice. Some key goals of this exercise are:

* Increase familiarization with C++ syntax and methods
* Correctly implement useful numerical algorithms
* Improve Test Driven Development (TDD) practices

Presently tests are written using the single header implementation of [Catch v2.13.4](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x).
